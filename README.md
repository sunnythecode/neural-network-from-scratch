Writing a neural network class with only numpy

Tested it out on MNIST in build.ipynb - result on test set is ~81% accuracy with 150 epochs

neural_net class is capable of scaling to any number of hidden layers and layer sizes

The neural_net class uses gradient descent(not stochastic or mini-batch), sigmoid activation function
